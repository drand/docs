This section introduces the key concepts behind drand. For information about consuming the randomness from a drand network, see the [Developer's Guide](/developer/), or for help running a drand network, see the [Operator's Guide](/operator/).

- [Overview](/docs/overview/) describes drand's main goals and gives an overview of the problems it aims to
  address.
- [Cryptography](/docs/cryptography/) provides an overview of the cryptographic building blocks that drand uses to generate publicly-verifiable, unbiased, and unpredictable randomness in a distributed manner.
- [Security model](/docs/security-model/) describes the security considerations taken into account when designing and building drand.
- [Specification](/docs/specification/) is a formal description of the drand protocols.
