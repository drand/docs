This section helps developers build applications that use drand as a source of randomness. For help running your own drand network, see the [Operator's Guide](/operator/).

The current public League of Entropy drand mainnet API endpoints are:

* `api.drand.sh` (HTTP(S) Endpoint)
* `api2.drand.sh` (HTTP(S) Endpoint)
* `api3.drand.sh` (HTTP(S) Endpoint)
* `https://drand.cloudflare.com` (HTTPS Endpoint)
* `/dnsaddr/api.drand.sh` (1st-level gossip relay endpoint)
* `/dnsaddr/api2.drand.sh` (1st-level gossip relay endpoint)
* `/dnsaddr/api3.drand.sh` (1st-level gossip relay endoint)

In order to retrieve randomness from a drand network you should **preferentially use the [drand client libraries](/developer/clients/) or the [drand-client CLI](/developer/drand-client/)**, which support the different mechanisms and perform verification for every value obtained.

Alternatively, you can interact directly with the endpoints. Make sure to manually verify every value:

- [HTTP API reference](/developer/http-api/)
- [Pubsub-based randomness distribution](/developer/gossipsub/)
- gRPC API: usually not publicly accessible. A gRPC API is supported by the drand client libraries, the `drand-client` CLI application and the [drand application](/operator/drand-cli/) itself (using `drand get public`).
