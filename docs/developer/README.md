This section helps developers build applications that use drand as a source of randomness. For help running a drand network, see the [Operator's Guide](/operator/).

There are several ways to consume randomness from a drand network:

- [Fetching randomness over HTTP](/developer/http-api/)
- [Using a drand client library](/developer/clients/)
- [Using the `drand` binary](/developer/cli/)
