# Community

The drand project is still in it's early stages, and we're building ways to interact with the community as we continue to build everything.

## GitHub & Slack

For now, the best way to join in with the community is [through GitHub](https://github.com/drand) or our [drand slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA).

## Mailing list

We now have an announcement mailing list for all Leauge of Entropy users. This mailing list is meant to announce any changes impacting Drand users downstream and is written and maintained by a League of Entropy secretariat. You can join the mailing list by visiting [groups.google.com/g/leagueofentropy-users](https://groups.google.com/g/leagueofentropy-users).
