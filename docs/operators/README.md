# Operator's Guide

This section contains information for `drand` node operators - the people deploying and maintaining `drand` networks.
For information about consuming the randomness from a `drand` network, see the [Builder's Guide](../builders/) instead.

The following guides are available:

- A [deployment guide](./deployment) that shows how to set up a `drand` network and perform necessary maintenance
- (TODO): A metrics guide that shows how to monitor a running network.
