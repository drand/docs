On Wednesday, March 10, 2021, The League of Entropy added [ZenGo](http://zengo.com/) to its list of members. 
ZenGo, the first keyless crypto wallet, aims to make it easy for anyone to start using crypto. 
A ZenGo wallet is self-hosted and uses advanced threshold cryptography to remove the private key 
entirely while still working to ensure that users have full control over their crypto. We are 
super excited to welcome ZenGo to the randomness revolution! 

The League of Entropy evaluates, votes on, and onboards new members quarterly. If you want to be a 
part of the first production-grade distributed randomness beacon and help provide publicly verifiable 
randomness as a service, contact us at [leagueofentropy@googlegroups.com](mailto:leagueofentropy@googlegroups.com). 
We are looking for enthusiastic teams with experience running secure production services who are interested in 
[operating a drand node](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zy_ki3Qk6ecg_APEjYlT9DBwzdJx9I_ImHvaUaIwKHU/).
