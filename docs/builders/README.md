# Builder's Guide

This section helps you build applications that use Drand as a source of randomness. For help running a Drand network, see the [Operator's Guide](../operators/).

There are several ways to consume randomness from a Drand network:

- [Using the `drand` binary](#using-the-drand-command-to-fetch-randomness)
- [Fetching randomness over HTTP](#fetching-randomness-over-http)
- [Receiving randomness using libp2p PubSub](#receiving-randomness-using-libp2p-pubsub)
- [Using a Drand client library](#using-a-drand-client-library)


## Using the `drand` command to fetch randomness

The `drand` command can be used to fetch randomness from a running Drand network. To do so, you'll need the group configuration file,
